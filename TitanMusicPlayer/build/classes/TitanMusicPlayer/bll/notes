SET TOOLTIPS. THEY WILL LOOK AWESOME!!!!!!

How do we keep playlists in the db? AS their own table? Do we have arrays available?




This is code from Library class rebuild for week 3.
This may be useful for future use when building the GUI

    /**Adds songs to library
     * Called by user interaction
     */
    private void AddSongToLibrary()
    {
        File songFile;      //Stores selected file object
        String filePath;    //Stores selected file's path
        
        //Open file dialog
        JFileChooser fileChooser = new JFileChooser();  //File Chooser object
        int status = fileChooser.showOpenDialog(null);  //Stores user choice
        if (status == fileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION)       //If file selected
        {
            songFile = fileChooser.getSelectedFile();   //Retrieve File object
            filePath = songFile.getPath();              //Store File path
            songList.add(filePath);                     //Add to Library list
        }
    }
    
    /**Removes song from Library
     * Requires selection of song(s) in Library list
     * Receives array of indices from Selection event
     */
    private void RemoveSongFromLibrary(int[] songIndices)
    {
        int count = 0;                                  //Count removed songs
        
        //Enhanced for loop to iterate through array
        for (int index : songIndices)
        {
            songList.remove(index);
            count++;
        }
        
        //Display # songs removed
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, count + " song(s) removed.");
    }
